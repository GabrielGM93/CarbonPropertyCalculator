# Property Calculator

This project is a work-in-progress calculator that allows you to assess the carbon footprint of various daily activities. It's designed with consideration of established emission factors and methodologies. It leverages reference data, including information from the Climatiq API, to provide accurate estimates.

## Inspiration and Foundation

This calculator is built on the work of various other carbon footprint calculators, including the WWF Ecological Footprint Calculator. By adopting their methodologies and emission factors, we've developed a customized tool for calculating carbon footprints in different scenarios.

## Methodology and Emission Factors

To ensure accuracy, you can find the calculator's methodology and the emission factors used in this repository. This allows you to verify the calculations and understand how carbon footprints are estimated for different activities.

## Code

The source code for this calculator has been implemented in Python. If you're interested in exploring how specific questions and conversions are handled, you can find code examples related to this in the repository. We've strived to keep the implementation as clear and accessible as possible.
